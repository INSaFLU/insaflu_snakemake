    The create_consensus_file_for_alignment function takes a list of files, the reference genome in genbank format,
    the species name and an output file name as input. It then creates a fasta file with all the sequences from the
    consensus files that have coverage above 90%. The function also takes into account if it is flu or not. If it is flu
    it will only include samples that have 8 loci covered at 90% or more in one file and in the other it will concatonate all
    segments that have 90% coverage or more.

    :param consensus: Specify the path to the directory containing all of your consensus sequences
    :param reference_gb: Get the name of the reference sequence in a genbank file
    :param species: Determine which reference file to use
    :param output: Name the output file
    :param coverage_file: Specify the file containing all the coverage values for each sample
    :param fasta_file: Get the reference sequence from the fasta file
    :param output_only_90_plus: Create a fasta file with only the sequences that have at least 90% coverage
